/* When looking at the YoY percent change in distance, flights and cancelation Delta Air Lines has 
an increased YoY percent change in distance and flights which could indicate operational growth, looking
at YoY percent change in cancellations we see a large decrease for Delta indicating expansion while minimizing
disruptions. In comparison to the other Airlines; American had a slight increase in change in YoY percent change
in distance and total flights, they also had a increase in YoY%change in cancelations. Southwest had a decrease 
in in YoY percent change in distance and a slight increase in total flights, however a large increase in
YoY%change in cancellations. 

Soley just based on this information the takeway would be to invest in Delta and possibly invest a little amount
in American maybe for diversification? But avoid Southwest as the data suggests possible issues such as 
scheduling problems, operational issues or maintenance problems reflected in the huge increase in cancellations, 
leading to decreased revenue. However it would be good to investigate other factors. */

/*SUMMARY: Based on this analysis considering seasonality and revenue Delta seems to manage
this the best. In terms of YoY percent change in distance number of flights and cancelation, analysis
could indicate operational growth for Delta with efficiency, Southwest shows perhaps a change in their
approach with increase in flights and decrease in distance but large increase in cancellations which could
not be good for revenue. Looking at equipment and fuel costs from this analysis, Southwest has a possible
lower equipment cost, but possibly the highest fuel cost. Delta and American have show similar equipment costs, 
with Delta having the the lowest fuel costs. Further analysis could be done on top airports and delays to evaluate
which Airlines fly the most to these Airports, and which Airlines effectively manage Delays. Based on this
anaylsis it would be suggested to invest in Delta Airline stock.
